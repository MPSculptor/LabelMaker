Your order has been paid via a Paypal eCheque, whereby Paypal has to request the payment from your linked bank account. For some unfathomable reason, this takes a full 7 days. As the order effectively remains unpaid until the funds transfer completes and the transaction can be cancelled at any point, it is our policy to only post out plants after the transfer date. If you would like us to send sooner than this it is always possible to take a payment over the phone and cancel the pending eCheque.
We are sorry for this inconvenience, but hope you understand our cautious stance.
Best Wishes
Martin"
